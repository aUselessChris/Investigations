Chapter 3 on Alex Hong is also featured in [Tayvano's research on DPRK](https://github.com/tayvano/lazarus-bluenoroff-research/blob/main/hacks-and-thefts/paid_network.md). Alex turned out to be a DPRK IT worker, and while we were discussing that possibility, at the time we were leaning more towards him being Chinese. The Chinese trail didn't lead anywhere and eventually [Tayvano](https://x.com/tayvano_) concluded his story as a North Korean operative.
